This is my attempt at better understanding the things i've learned in the last year. The course was quite long and contained such breadth of scope. Having so many topics and libraries that use them that I felt the need to build a few applications 'on my own'. 

I've intently asked for guidance from people that have a real, practical, understanding of the various layers involved in this endevour - for which I am grateful.

Funk was here!
